# Project Title

REM Journal

## Description

We spend a third our lives asleep and there is still so much mystery around why. This inspired me to create an application that allows you to keep a record of dreams, which happen each night during the REM cycle of sleep. This is especially helpful for those that struggle to remember dreams, writing them down the moment you wake up is the trick to remembering.
